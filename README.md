## About Monty

During one's studies a computer science student is confronted with several different programming languages. Each of those has its own advantages and disadvantages for its certain kind of purpose. There is C/C++, which is extremely fast at runtime, because it is compiled to native machine code. On the other hand it is not very handy to use, especially if we are talking about memory management. Another example is Java, which is more comfortable to use, because it supports garbage collection and some other modern programming language features. The problem about Java is, that it comes with a lot of characteristics inherited from C++ which are not very intuitive to use and apart from that Java applications are slower because of the virtual machine architecture. Besides those two examples there are plenty of other languages. Some developers distinguish between scripting and programming languages. 

Scripting languages usually have a catchy and easily understandable syntax. This supports very fast development and rapid prototyping. Generally the runtime performance of scripted applications is not as good as in classic programming languages, because the scripts are not compiled, but interpreted at runtime. Often another disadvantage of scripting languages is the missing type safety. A good example of that is Python.

## The Motivation

There are already thousands of programming languages. In some cases the differences between them are significant, in other cases they are very similar. So, why should one develop a new programming language?

The classic programming languages like C++ or Java are mainly about efficient implementations, while scripting languages target more on the ease of use. Between those two worlds there is a gap â€¦ until now.

Monty is thought to unite both worlds, without suffering legacy oddities from other languages. As a general purpose language it should provide the highest comfort for developers at the maximum of possible performance. That means that out goal is to design and implement a new language which has both, dynamic and static typing and provides the following features for developers:
<ul>
<li>intuitive and readable syntax</li>
<li>rapid implementation of application ideas (comfort)</li>
<li>compiled language (quick execution)</li>
</ul>
